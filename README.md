# MATLAB_Free_Falling_Ball

This set of files uses a more complex but general approach 
to demonstrate how to solve the trajectory of a freely falling ball. 

Firstly, I created "gen_model.m" and ran it 
to generate "param.mat", "FFB_function.m" and "Event_TD.m".
Note that these three files are generated in MATLAB. 

Then I created "main.m" to read in the previously created data 
and use ode45 command to solve the equation. 
I recorded a video and created this file for it. Please see:
